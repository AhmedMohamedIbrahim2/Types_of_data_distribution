# What are the different types of data distribution?

There are two types of data distribution based on two different kinds of data: Discrete and Continuous. Discrete data distributions include binomial distributions, Poisson distributions, and geometric distributions. Continuous data distributions include normal distributions and the Student's t-distribution.

# How do you find the distribution of data?

A probability plot is used to determine the distribution of data. It is a test that graphs data points along a straight line. Data that fit along that line qualify as that given type of distribution.

# There are two different types of data in statistics: discrete data and continuous data :

1)- Discrete Data

Discrete data involves variables that have specific values that cannot have values between them. For example, the number of times someone visits their neighbors during the week is a discrete variable. Someone can visit their neighbor 0, 1, 2, 3, or even 10 times during the week. However, someone cannot visit their neighbor 1.65 or 3.09 times. Categorical variables (e.g., genres of music, political parties) are also considered discrete variables because they involve clear categorical boundaries.

2)- Continuous Data

Continuous data involves variables in which there could be an infinite number of values between a set range of possible values. For example, students can theoretically score an infinite number of final exam grades on a scale of 0 to 100. Someone could score a 90, 90.01, 90.324, 90.993, 89.873, etc. Another example of a continuous variable are things measured in time. A 26-year-old might express their age as 26, 26.25, or 26.2534 depending on their level of specificity.
